==============================================================

    :alt: Async object document mapper for tornado

MongoMotor is a tiny integration of
`MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_, a
document-object mapper for python and mongodb, with
`Motor <http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`_, an asynchronous driver
for mongodb built on top of tornado's mainloop

Using MongoMotor you can define your documents as you already do with
MongoEngine, use all query niceties you already know and do all db operations
asynchronously using Motor.


Installation
============

Straight-forward installation, using pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install mongomotor

And that's it!


MongoMotor usage
================

To use MongoMotor is very similar to use of MongoEngine. To define your
documents there's no difference, except on import. This is why we'll use
the same example used on mongoengine's tutorial. We'll create a simple
thumblelog.


Defining documents
++++++++++++++++++

To begin, lets define the following documents:

.. code-block:: python

    # In the imports here we change ``mongoengine`` to ``mongomotor``.
    from mongomotor import connect, Document, EmbeddedDocument
    from mongomotor.fields import (StringField, ReferenceField, ListField,
				   EmbeddedDocumentField)

    # First creating the conection with database
    connect('mongomotor-test')


    # Here the documents are the same used in mongoengine's tutorial
    class User(Document):
	email = StringField(required=True)
	first_name = StringField(max_length=50)
	last_name = StringField(max_length=50)


    class Comment(EmbeddedDocument):
	content = StringField()
	name = StringField(max_length=120)


    class Post(Document):
	title = StringField(max_length=120, required=True)
	author = ReferenceField(User)
	tags = ListField(StringField(max_length=30))
	comments = ListField(EmbeddedDocumentField(Comment))

	meta = {'allow_inheritance': True}


    class TextPost(Post):
	content = StringField()


    class ImagePost(Post):
	image_path = StringField()


    class LinkPost(Post):
	link_url = StringField()


Now, the usage is practically the same of mongoengine. Lets see:


Adding data
+++++++++++

To add a new document to database, we'll do everything as with mongoengine,
but with the difference that when we use the save() method, we use the
keyword ``yield``

.. code-block:: python

    author = User(email='niceguy@example.com', first_name='Nice', last_name='Guy')
    yield author.save()

    post1 = TextPost(title='Fun with MongoMotor', author=author)
    post1.content = 'Took a look at MongoEngine today, looks pretty cool.'
    post1.tags = ['mongodb', 'motor', 'mongoengine', 'mongomotor']
    yield post1.save()

    post2 = LinkPost(title='MongoMotor Documentation', author=author)
    post2.link_url = 'http://mongomotor-ptbr.readthedocs.org/pt/latest/'
    post2.tags = ['mongomotor']
    yield post2.save()


Accessing data
++++++++++++++

Now we already have some posts we can access them. Again, it's like with
mongoengine, except we use ``yield`` when accessing database:

.. code-block:: python

    # Here listing all posts that inherited from Post
    for post_future in Post.objects:
        post = yield post_future
        print(post.title)

    # Here only TextPost from ``author``
    for post_future in TextPost.objects.filter(author=author):
        post = yield post_future
        print(post.content)

    # And here filtering by tags
    for post_future in TextPost.objects(tags='mongomotor'):
        post = yield post_future
        print(post.content)

    # We could use the method ``to_list()`` to transform a queryset
    # into a list.
    posts = yield TextPost.objects.filter(tags='mongomotor')[:10].to_list()
    for post in posts:
        print(post.title)


.. note::

   While it appears that each document is retrieved individually, in fact this
   is the
   `same behavior <http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/api/motor_cursor.html#motor.MotorCursor.fetch_next>`_
   of motor's ``fetch_index``, which, by its instance, retrieve the documents
   in
   `large batches <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/cursors/#cursor-batches>`_.
   Apeser de parecer que cada documento é recuperado individualmente (por causa
   deste monte de ``yield``), na verdade é o


When we use ``get()`` we also need to use ``yield``, like this:

.. code-block:: python

    post = yield TextPost.objects.get(title='Fun with MongoMotor')

The same to access a ReferenceField

.. code-block:: python

    author = yield post.author

to use the method ``first()`` which (obviously) returns the first result of the query

.. code-block:: python

    post = yield Post.objects.order_by('-title').first()

or when we delete some document from database:

.. code-block:: python

    yield post.delete()

We can use the aggregation methods too, like
``sum()``, ``count()``, ``average()``...

.. code-block:: python

    total_posts = yield Post.objects.count()
    tags_frequencies = yield Post.objects.item_frequencies('tags')

Changelog
=========

v0.8
++++

* Backing ComplexBaseField and ReferenceField behavior to old one. It
  now always returns a future. The other way was confusing.

v0.7
++++++

* Added eager_on on get() method of queryset.
* Corrected how ComplexBaseField and ReferenceField handle references.
  Now it only returns a future when the database is really reached.
* Adding modify() to queryset
* Updating motor to 0.6.2. That changed aggregate interface. It now returns
  a cursor.
